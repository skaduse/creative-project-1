<h2 class='intro-text'>Welcome to the home of Utah van dwellers!</h2>

<div class='home-image'> <img src="Van Dweller B&W.jpg"/></div>

<div class='intro'>The average rent for a one bedroom apartment in the United
  States is currently over $900 a month or $10,800 a year (according to Google).
  That’s a lot of money, especially with a low paying job. How are young people
  supposed to get ahead with that kind of a drain on their monthly income?
  Landlords collect money every month and at the end of the lease the tenant has
   nothing to show for it. Granted the landlord takes responsibility for the
   building and incurs the mortgage and maintenance cost. But in the end the
   landlord keeps both the rent  and the apartment. Rentals have their place in
   certain situations. But if a young person with a low paying job was able to
   hold onto their hard earned rent money it could really help them to get ahead.
    With all that money a person would be able to quickly save a down payment to
    buy a house. Or you could pay off student loan debts and step off the hamster
    wheel of life and travel unencumbered by the stresses of constantly having to
    come up with next months rent.</div>

  <h2>Hot Forum Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How can I get a better wireless signal from my van? I spend a lot of time
    in the wilderness of southern Utah and sometimes struggle to pick up signal
    even though I have 4g.</li>

    <li>I’m building my van out this week, and I am a type 1 diabetic. I MUST have
      refrigeration for my insulin. I’m wondering what is, in your experience,
      the best method of doing this. Plug in cooler, or just get a really nice
      ice chest and refill it with ice every time I go to the store?</li>

    <li>Does anyone know best heater options to reduce condensation? I live in
      Canada and have a propane tank installed on my van. I am concerned about
      condensation as I didn't do my research and insulated with rock wool. From
       what I've read Propex is a good option, but it's expensive and requires a
       battery to operate. I've also read that wood stoves may be a good option.
        I already bought a small propane heater but it is not installed.</li>

    <li>Is this realistic: finding work in a ski resort town or something similar
      and living/camping out of my car in the nearby wilderness? This would be
      out of state. Will employers be weirded out that my legal residence is 2000
       miles away?</li>
  </ul>
