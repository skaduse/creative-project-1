    <h2>Indie Film 'Nomadland' Nominated for an Oscar, Details Van Dwelling Lifestyle</h2>
    <p>U.S. film "Nomadland", which earned six Oscar nominations on Monday, tells
      the story of a woman who becomes a nomad in the wake of the economic
      recession - spotlighting a way of life that has seen an explosion of interest
       in the time of coronavirus. The U.S. recession drama, which follows the
       story of an itinerant Amazon warehouse worker who lives in her oversize
       recreational vehicle (RV), received six nods, including best picture and
       best director for Chinese-born filmmaker Chloe Zhao.Of the 11.2 million
       RV owners in the United States, about 1.5% are "full-timers" and more than
       half of those continue to work and live with their children, according to
       the RV Industry Association.</p>

      <h2>Outrageous Designs For Nomadic Living In A Post-Pandemic World</h2>
      <p>For years there has been a growing desire from individuals who want to
        leave everything behind and move away from material possessions. The
        nomadic lifestyle is a rebellious way of leaving a permanent, expensive
        living and utilize movable structures that can become temporary homes and
        communities. The nomadic movement is growing even faster following the
        release of the award-winning film “Nomadland,” in which a woman embarks on
        a journey through America, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad.

        With unconventional designs, nomadic architecture incorporates the benefits
        of urban dwellings with that of a roving lifestyle. New designers create
        outrageous yet realistic concepts that inspire others to embrace the nomadic
         lifestyle in an attempt to find meaning and fulfillment in their lives.</p>

    <h2>People Are Turning Shipping Containers Into Tiny Homes. Here Are the Pros
      and Cons</h2>
      <p>To most people, a 2018 Ram ProMaster is just a vehicle. For Chelsey Hathman,
        it’s home.Squeezed out of her Texas condo by the hidden costs of homeownership,
        such as maintenance and homeowners association fees, Hathman, 29, sold the
        place and moved into her 60-square-foot van. “I wanted financial freedom,”
         she says. But living in a van is only one step toward Hathman’s ultimate
         goal: living in a shipping container. “What I really want is to be able
         to save up enough money to buy a container home for myself,” says Hatham.
         “It would be much more affordable for me than a condo or larger house.” A
         container home is a dwelling made from recycled steel shipping containers
         that may have been used as a cargo carrier on a ship, train, or truck.
         Because they’re small and repurposed, container homes are seen as
         environmentally friendly. And though they come with unique costs, like
         permits and land ownership, they can be much cheaper than a traditional home.</p>
